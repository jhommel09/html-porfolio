            <p>Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game
                 by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients 
                 (DotA), a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's 
                 Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches
                  between two teams of five players, with each team occupying 
                  and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the 
                  ten players independently controls a character known as a hero
                   that has unique abilities and differing styles of play. During
                    a match, players collect experience points (XP) and items 
                    for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in
                     player versus player (PvP) combat. A team wins by being the 
                     first to destroy the other team's Ancient, a large durable 
                     structure located in the center of each base.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer
                of Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to design a 
                modernized remake in the Source game engine. It was released 
                for Windows, OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution 
                platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta
                phase that began two years prior. The game is fully
                free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay element 
                needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To maintain it,
                Valve supports the game as a service, selling loot boxes
                and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that
                offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such 
                as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs. The game was
                ported to the Source 2 engine in 2015, making it the first
                game to use it.

                In December 2002, Aeonsoft developed the first provisional prototype 
                of the game, called Clockworks Ltd. In September 2003, the company 
                changed the game's name to Flyff, and began its first closed beta in Korea.
                In July 2004, it won the Game of the Month award from the Korean Ministry
                of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Over the next year, it was launched in
                three more countries: China, Taiwan, and Thailand. In October 2005, the 
                US received the closed beta, which ran for a month before Flyff was 
                commercially launched in December.

                It introduces a new skill system with 240 active skill gems and 200 support gems. 
                There will be twelve character classes that have three ascendancy classes each. New 
                weapons will be introduced such as spears, crossbows and flail, as well as supplementary
                items like focuses, traps and redesigned scepters. The passive skill tree will have 
                2000 skills and will allow dual specialization. A dodge roll movement mechanic will 
                be added. Spirit, a resource used to reserve things like auras, will be utilized.
                Many other changes such as permanent minions, trigger skills, game engine and graphic 
                improvements, and more, will be a part of the sequel.[1][2] After completing the six-act 
                storyline, players will gain access to more than 100 endgame maps with their own boss fight 
                and modifiers that enable revamped versions of many of Path of Exile's past leagues.

                 release on December 21, 2016.[12][7] A spinoff game called War Thunder Mobile (also

                War Thunder is based around combined arms battles on air, land, and sea.[23] Vehicles 
                range from pre-World War I (ships only)[24] to modern day,[25] with an emphasis on World
                War II,[26][27] the Vietnam War, and the Cold War.[28] Players can control aircraft,
                ground vehicles, and warships from ten nations with a set of technology trees attached
                to them: United States, Germany, Russia, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, China, Sweden
                and Israel. The game also incorporates other nations, including Argentina, Australia, 
                Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus,[29] Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark,
                Egypt, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Jordan, Kazakhstan,[29] Kuwait, 
                Lithuania, the Netherlands, North Korea, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, 
                Romania, Syria, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Vietnam (both North and South) 
                and Saudi Arabia. These nations are included either as "sub-trees" (parts of the research 
                trees of bigger nations being dedicated to a smaller nation) or premium vehicles, 
                purchasable with real money or in-game currency.

                World of Tanks (WoT) is an armoured warfare-themed multiplayer online game developed
                 by Wargaming, featuring 20th century (1910sâ€“1970s) era combat vehicles.[1] It is 
                 built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, but participants
                  also have the option of paying a fee for use of "premium" features. The focus is on 
                  player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle, from the 
                  time of Pre-World War 2 to the Cold War-era.
